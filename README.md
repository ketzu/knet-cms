# knet-cms

This is the custom mini CMS (content management system) I built for my personal website: ketzu.net

I consider this an example project for fun, not a drop in CMS for everyone, as I created the sql tables manually.
The tables I used are exported into [knet_cms.sql](knet_cms.sql).

Project dependent changes if you want to try it:

Database conection is configured in [util/config.php](util/config.php).

Superuser Password (singular) is configured in [login.php](login.php), as there is only one user.
